NAME
    Progress::Any::Output - Assign output to progress indicators

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.04 of Progress::Any::Output (from Perl
    distribution Progress-Any-Output), released on 2014-10-14.

SYNOPSIS
    In your application:

     use Progress::Any::Output;
     Progress::Any::Output->set('TermProgressBarColor');

    To give parameters to output:

     Progress::Any::Output->set('TermProgressBarColor', width=>50, ...);

    To assign output to a certain (sub)task:

     Progress::Any::Output->set({task=>'main.download'}, 'TermMessage');

    To add additional output, use add() instead of set().

DESCRIPTION
    See Progress::Any for overview.

METHODS
  Progress::Any::Output->set([ \%opts ], $output[, @args]) => obj
    Set (or replace) output. Will load and instantiate
    "Progress::Any::Output::$output". To only set output for a certain
    (sub)task, set %opts to "{ task => $task }". @args will be passed to
    output module's constructor.

    Return the instantiated object.

    If $output is an object (a reference, really), it will be used as-is.

  Progress::Any::Output->add([ \%opts ], $output[, @args])
    Like set(), but will add output instead of replace existing one(s).
